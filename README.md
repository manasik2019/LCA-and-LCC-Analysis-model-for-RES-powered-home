# LCA-and-LCC-Analysis-model-for-RES-powered-home

In this paper, we consider a solar powered residential energy system based on three different scenarios. In the first scenario, the
energy is supplied to the house through a grid and a PV. In the second scenario, a storage system is added to store
excess energy for future use. The last scenario consider an optimization algorithm to control the electricity flow
between the energy storage, the energy load, and the supply. We applied an LCA and an LCC approach integrated
with Analytic Hierarchy Process (AHP) to assess the sustainability of these systems.
